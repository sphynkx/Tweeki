# Tweeki, a Bootstrap based skin for MediaWiki

This is custom tune of (original Tweeki skin)[https://github.com/thaider/Tweeki] for (Veda.Wiki)[https://veda.wiki/] project.

Tweeki is a skin for **[MediaWiki](http://mediawiki.org/)** (1.35+) based on
**[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** (v4.6.2). It tries to implement as
much of Bootstrap's functionality as possible, allowing to use it very easily and with 
very reduced markup, and features many configuration options.

You can find an instance of Tweeki in action and the extended documentation at the 
project's website **[tweeki.kollabor.at](http://tweeki.kollabor.at/)**
